# Dependency Submission Toolkit

`@github/dependency-submission-toolkit` is a TypeScript library for creating
dependency snapshots and submitting them to the dependency submission API.
Snapshots are a set of dependencies grouped by manifest with some related
metadata. A manifest can be a physical file or a more abstract representation of
a dependency grouping (such processing of program outputs). After submission to
the API, the included dependencies appear in the repository's
[dependency graph](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph).

## Installation

```
npm install @github/dependency-submission-toolkit
```

## Writing Your Own Dependency Submission Action

You may use classes from `@github/dependency-submission-toolkit` to help in
building your own GitHub Action for submitting dependencies to the Dependency
Submission API. At a high level, the steps to use the classes are:

1. Create a `PackageCache` of all of the packages that could be included in your
   manifest, as well define as the relationships between them.

2. Using the packages defined in `PackageCache`, create a `Manifest` or a
   `BuildTarget`, which defines the dependencies of the build environment or
   specific build artifact.

3. Create a `Snapshot` to include one or more `Manifests` or `BuildTargets`. The
   snapshot is the base container for submitting dependencies to the Dependency
   Submission API.

4. Follow the instructions for
   [Creating a JavaScript Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action).
   These include:

   - Defining an `action.yml` action metadata file
   - Compiling the JavaScript into a single script using `ncc`
   - Testing your action in a workflow

A full example action using this library is included in the `example/`
directory. This example uses the output from the `npm list` to create an
accurate and complete graph of the dependencies used in this library. This
action is also included in a workflow in this repository and runs for each
commit to the `main` branch.
